In this project, completed for STA414 during the winter semester of 2020, I learned how to train a model to classify some digits in the MNIST dataset, and to make predictions, samples, and interpolations from the latent space using the Julia programming language. The beauty of this very clean dataset lured me into a very messy space.

#### Picture Vergil — _Georgics 2.483-492_

In this project, I attempted to represent ten lines (2.483-492) from Vergil's famous farming poem visually, comparing syntactical, diction, and metrical (i.e. sound) qualities between the original and three increasingly modern translations (respectively by John Dryden, Cecil Day Lewis, and Peter Fallon). In this passage, the poet describes an idyllic landscape and laments the difficulty of really occupying the space. The same difficulty can be seen in the challenges that too literal-minded a visualization method results in. Read the original poem [here](https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Georgicon/Liber_II).
