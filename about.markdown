Hello! My name is Yilin and I am a recent undergrad from UofT. I majored in Statistics and LCT (Literature and Critical Theory). My interests include painting, drawing, Latin, mathematics, and learning to do all those things with computers. Thank you so much for visiting my site, and I hope you will see some interesting things here, as well as lots of growth in the future.

You can see my resume [here](/assets/Resume_ylz.pdf).
